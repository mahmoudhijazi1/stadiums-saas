# Progress log

Entries are appended at the end, newest last, and kept short (a heading, **When**, **What**, **Why**, **Files**, **How it connects**, **How to verify**). Never edit an old entry; add a **Correction** entry instead. When this file passes about 300 lines, move it to `docs/archive/progress-<year>[-n].md` with `git mv` and start a new one. The earlier log (to `v1.0.0` and the refactor steps 1 to 6c) is [archive/progress-2026.md](./archive/progress-2026.md); read it with `tail`, never in full.

## Docs reset 4: agent instructions and the log

**When:** 2026-10-14

**What:** Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` (read first, non-negotiables, placement rules, clean-code checklist, workflow, `test/architecture/rules.ts` as the source of truth). `AGENTS.md` now starts with "Read CLAUDE.md first". The old `docs/progress.md` (7,000+ lines) moved with `git mv` to `docs/archive/progress-2026.md`; this file starts again.

**Why:** One short instruction file for every coding agent, and a log small enough to read.

**Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/progress.md`, `docs/archive/progress-2026.md`.

**How it connects:** Docs only.

**How to verify:** `npx tsc --noEmit`; `npx jest test/architecture`.

## Docs reset 5: a docs check

**When:** 2026-10-14

**What:** `test/docs/docs.test.ts` (6 tests): the core docs and `docs/domain/*` have the three header lines; every backticked path starting with `src/`, `test/`, `docs/`, `scripts/` or `prisma7.config.ts` in the core docs and `CLAUDE.md` exists (patterns with `*`, `<>`, `{}` are skipped); `docs/CODEMAP.md` lists every folder under `src/modules` and names none that does not exist; every relative link resolves. The first run found stale paths (`src/lib/qr.ts` in the RUNBOOK, `src/app/owner/layout.tsx` and a folder-structure link in owner-ia), now fixed. `docs/guides/testing-jest.md` describes the architecture and docs checks.

**Why:** Keep the living docs true after the cleanup.

**Files:** `test/docs/docs.test.ts`, `docs/guides/testing-jest.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/owner-ia.md`.

**How it connects:** The test reads files only; it imports nothing from `src/`.

**How to verify:** `npx jest test/docs` (6 passed); `npx tsc --noEmit`; `npx jest test/architecture` (12 passed).

## Key files: docs/KEY-FILES.md

**When:** 2026-10-14

**What:** New `docs/KEY-FILES.md`: the 15 files where a mistake would break money, bookings, tenant isolation or login (proxy, tenant-context, db, platform-db, can, login and session, rate-limit, the exclusion migration, bookings.ts, approve, request-public-slot, create-owner-booking, availability, record-payment, shop pricing). Each has Does, Why, Used by, Never change without (the invariant and the test files, all checked to exist). From your list `booking/domain/series.ts` was left out (feature-level, not isolation or money core; noted in the file) and "the payment collection use case" became `payment/application/record-payment.ts`, which writes payment, tenders and ledger for every collection path. Linked under Start here in `docs/README.md` and added to the core docs checked by `test/docs/docs.test.ts`. Branched from `refactor/08-docs` because `main` does not yet have the docs index or the docs test.

**Why:** A new developer should know which files to treat with care and what proves them safe.

**Files:** `docs/KEY-FILES.md`, `docs/README.md`, `test/docs/docs.test.ts`.

**How it connects:** Docs only; no code under `src/` changed.

**How to verify:** `npx jest test/docs` (6 passed). Claims marked UNVERIFIED in the file were not traced to code.

## Step 7a: bookings.ts split by topic (branch `refactor/07a-bookings`)

**When:** 2026-10-14

**What:** `src/modules/booking/infrastructure/bookings.ts` (1,830 lines) became the folder `bookings/` (`git mv` to `bookings/index.ts`, then 14 topic files plus `_shared.ts`): create, locks, pending, single, ranges, status, due, interests, day, person-history, debts, owed, per-player, labels. `index.ts` is `export *` of each, so no importer changed. Code moved as is: no SQL, logic, name or signature change; the only text differences are `export` added to four helpers that two files share (`asDate`, `BookingSqlRow`, `toBookingForDecision`, `RECENT_WINDOW_MS`, now in `_shared.ts`, which is not re-exported) and a top comment on `locks.ts` pointing to the lock-order table. A line-by-line comparison of the old and new files (imports excluded) shows exactly those differences, and `queryRaw` / `executeRaw` / `Prisma.sql` occurs 38 times before and after. `TABS_REMAINING_SQL` went next to its only user (`day.ts`).

**Why:** One 1,800-line file mixing inserts, locks, queries and per-player writes was hard to review; locks now have their own small file.

**Files:** `src/modules/booking/infrastructure/bookings/*`, `docs/CODEMAP.md`, `docs/KEY-FILES.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the P lock line).

**How it connects:** Same imports as before in each file (Prisma, tenant context, domain pending-inbox); no file imports `application`.

**How to verify:** `npx tsc --noEmit`; `npx jest test/architecture test/docs test/modules/booking`. Integration tests (Docker Postgres) were not run.

## Step 7b: upcoming-panel split and action groups (branch `refactor/07b-panel`)

**When:** 2026-10-14

**What:** `booking/ui/upcoming-panel.tsx` (1,030 lines) is now `upcoming-panel.tsx` (the lists, the open-sheet state, 282 lines), `upcoming-rows.tsx` (86) and the folder `booking-sheet/`: `booking-sheet.tsx` (215, the composition), `sheet-header.tsx` (128), `sheet-details.tsx` (88, `UpcomingRowActions`), `money-block.tsx` (198), `shop-tabs.tsx` (36), `series-row.tsx` (17), `extend-entry.tsx` (20), `more-actions.tsx` (96), `action-row.tsx` (41) and `row-view.ts` (85, `UpcomingRowView`, `owesCash`, and two small helpers for rules that two parts share). JSX and logic copied as it was. The 18 flat action props became five typed groups, each type next to the component that uses it: `CollectActions` (money-block: submitCollectPayment, submitSwitchToPerPlayer, submitSwitchToWhole, submitCollectSlot, submitCollectAllRemaining), `ExtendActions` (extend-form: submitExtendBooking), `ItemsActions` (booking-items: searchPayers, submitAddBookingItems, submitCollectTab, submitRemoveBookingItem), `SeriesActions` (series-manage: loadSeriesSheetAction, previewCancelRestAction, previewSeriesAction, submitCancelRest, submitSeriesSave), `FeeActions` (fee-forms: submitCancelBooking, submitRecordNoShow, submitAdjustBookingDue). The panel takes the five objects; the sheet hands each child its own group (spread where the child already takes those names, explicit for the fee forms and the weekly confirm). The only route that renders the panel, `today/_components/lists.tsx`, builds the five objects from the same actions. `UpcomingRowView` is still exported from `upcoming-panel.tsx`.

**Why:** One 1,000-line client component mixed the lists, the sheet state, the header, the money block and every action prop.

**Files:** `src/modules/booking/ui/{upcoming-panel,upcoming-rows}.tsx`, `src/modules/booking/ui/booking-sheet/*`, the four group-owning components, `today/_components/lists.tsx`, `docs/CODEMAP.md`.

**How it connects:** booking/ui still imports no application, infrastructure or `@/app` code (architecture test passes).

**How to verify:** `npx tsc --noEmit` (clean, checked with `.next` excluded: a half-written `.next/dev/types/validator.ts` from a running dev server breaks the plain command); `npx jest test/architecture test/docs test/modules/booking test/app test/components` (46 suites, 360 tests). The sheet was not rendered in a browser and there is no component test for it: UNVERIFIED at runtime.

## Release v1.1.0

**When:** 2026-10-14

**What:** The app is marked version 1.1.0: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` say `1.1.0` (were `1.0.0`), `docs/NOW.md` names `v1.1.0`, and the commit is tagged `v1.1.0` in git. It includes the whole architecture cleanup (steps 1 to 7b and the docs reset).

**Why:** A named release point after the refactor, so the server can deploy a tag and roll back to `v1.0.0` (RUNBOOK, "Roll back to a tag").

**Files:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `docs/NOW.md`, `docs/progress.md`.

**How it connects:** Version label and status text only; no code or behaviour changes.

**How to verify:** `git tag -l v1.1.0`; `npm pkg get version` prints `"1.1.0"`. Nothing was run for the release itself; the full suites, the integration tests and the build were not run in this session (CI runs them).
